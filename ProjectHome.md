The Mouse Click Recorder program has applicability to blind professionals in a number of jobs. Given an image of any real-world object, a form of measurement, and several clicked coordinates of the image from a sighted assistant, a blind person can calculate and gain a better perception of the dimensions of real world objects. For example, a blind biology student can use photography as a recording tool to track a plantâ€™s growth over time.
The student is provided a jpg image of a plant like the one shown in Figure 9, and asked to determine the height of the plant. The jpg image also contains a picture of a ruler next to the plant. The student can calculate the height of the plant, after determining the pixel locations of the bottom and top of the ruler as well as the bottom and top of the plant with the help of his sighted assistant (to click the designated locations). The blind biology student may now review an ASCII file to get the recorded pixel coordinates from the image along with related notes
